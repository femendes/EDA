A group of wine appraiser requested an data analysis to see what the distribution of wine types around the world is based on score and price.
From this analysis, it was possible to verify the best cost-benefit and the location of the best wines for this group to plan their travel itinerary.

 

## 2. Data collecting

The presented scenario of the proposal has as data sources the files in .csv format available in Kaggle. It is possible to access the wine data source by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews) and the location used is [GPS coordinates for every world country and every USA state](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state).

### 3.1 Data treatment

Numerical variables were analyzed to verify data distribution, deviation of points and price around the mean and outliers. Thus, filling in the missing data of the points was used the mean because the distribution of the data looks like a normal distribution.

| Variables | Max    | Min  |	Mean  | Median | Std	 | Skew  | Kutosis |
| :---      | :---   | :--- | :---  | :---   | :---  | :---  | :---    |
| Price     |	3300.0 | 4.0	| 35.36 | 25.0   | 41.02 | 18.00 | 829.52  |
| Points    | 100.0  | 80.0	| 88.45 |	88.0   | 3.04	 | 0.05	 | -0.30   |
